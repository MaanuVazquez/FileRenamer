# FileRenamer
fileRenamer lets you rename all the files in a folder with an index and it detects if it is a serie and renames with the S00E00 format.

## Usage

Select the directory where the files to rename are with the "..." button.
On the second field of the app put the name of the one of the files with the token * this way:
if the name of the file is book 3.pdf just put book * if the file is a serie file:
mr robot s01e01 [hdtv].mkv just insert mr robot *
Finally on the last field just insert the name you want to the files rename to.
